# Destroyer Of Worlds
A tool I threw together for Minecraft speedrunners to automatically delete old worlds.

This is pretty simple and should be self-explanatory, but just in case:
You choose your .minecraft/saves/ folder, and click the "Start Deleting" button, and until you close the program or click "Stop Deleting", it will delete any worlds in the /saves/ folder that fit the "New World (1..2..3..etc)" or the older "New World---" format. It will only try to delete old worlds while you are generating a new one.
There's also a "Hide Path" option for streamers, just in case.

Take note that I've only tested this on Windows 10, and while there aren't any bugs I'm aware of, the purpose of this program is to DELETE THINGS, and while it should never, ever delete anything other than folders with "New World (x)" or "New World--" inside the folder you specify, sometimes bad things happen.
Be aware of the risks of downloading something that hasn't undergone extremely extensive testing.
